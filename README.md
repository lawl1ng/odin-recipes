# odin-recipes
This is a project to practice HTML skills acquired from The Odin Project. 

The project is a basic recipe website. It consists of a main index page which has links to a few recipes. As of 7th March 2025 due to only applying HTML, it will not look very pretty, but the idea is to revisit the project in future to style it using CSS.
