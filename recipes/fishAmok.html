    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fish Amok is a popular dish in South East Asia, specifically Cambodia, but the ingredients can be found in a
        popular thai dish as well, the name of which I can't remember just now... anyway! It's so so nice!</p>
    <p>This delicious and aromatic dish has fish, curry, and coconut flavours all in one. The presentation of the dish
        can be absolutely mesmerising when served in a banana leaf (although probably tricky to do if you've never done
        it before). If you want my honest opinion, don't make it - go out and get it at a restaurant! Good luck!</p>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the kroeung curry paste, put all the ingredients in a large pestle and mortar and pound until a smooth
            paste is formed. Heat the oil in a wok and fry the paste, stirring almost constantly for 10 minutes, or
            until darkened in colour. Tip out into a bowl and leave to cool a little.</li>
        <li>For the amok, stir the coconut milk into the curry paste. Beat the eggs into the curry paste mixture. Stir
            in the fish and gently fold in the coriander.</li>
        <li>If using the banana or palm leaves to create traditional ‘dishes’, do this now following the information in
            the tips section. Alternatively, spoon the amok into a heatproof dish and place in a steamer for about 10
            minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the amok has set.</li>
        <li>For the morning glory, heat the oil in a large wok, add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the morning
            glory and stir-fry for about 3 minutes, adding a splash of water if needed to help cook through and stop
            burning. Take off the heat and stir through the soy sauce.</li>
        <li>To serve, garnish the amok with the lime leaves, bird's-eye chilli and coconut. Serve the amok dishes (or
            divide into four if you cooked it in one bowl) with the morning glory, rice and red chillies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Recipe tips</h4>
    <p>If using banana or palm leaves to create ‘dishes’, do this by dividing each leaf in half and cutting out a circle
        from each half using a pan lid as a guide. Bring a wide saucepan of water to the boil and add the leaves for 1
        minute, or until softened. Remove and leave to cool. Create a dish shape from the banana leaf by pinning up the
        sides of the circle using four toothpicks. Alternatively, use baking paper or heavy duty kitchen foil to create
        dishes.</p>

    <p>If you don’t like too much heat, remove the seeds and white membranes from the chillies.</p>
