    3 tablespoons vegetable oil
    ▢2 shallots (thinly sliced)
    ▢7 cloves garlic (sliced)
    ▢3 Thai bird or holland chilies (de-seeded, if desired, and thinly sliced)
    ▢1 pound ground pork (450g)
    ▢1 teaspoon sugar
    ▢1 tablespoon fish sauce
    ▢1 tablespoon thin/light soy sauce
    ▢2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
    ▢2 teaspoons oyster sauce
    ▢⅓ cup low sodium chicken broth or water
    ▢holy basil leaves (about 1 1/2 cups packed)

    In a wok over medium high heat, add the oil, shallots and garlic, and fry for 3 minutes. Add the chilies and cook
    for another minute. Crank up the heat to high, and add the ground pork, breaking it up into small bits and allowing
    it to crisp up.
    Add the sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Stir-fry for another minute and deglaze the
    pan with the broth or water. Because your pan is over high heat, the liquid should cook off very quickly. Add the
    basil, and stir-fry until wilted. Serve over rice.
