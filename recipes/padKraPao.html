    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pad Kra Pao is a very popular dish in Thailand. It is sweet, spicy and salty. When cooked well it's very tasty!
        (Or as they say in Thailand, aloy mak!)</p>
    <p>It's an easy dish to make, and relatively cheap. The colours are beautiful with the white and dark of the rice
        and meat respectively, and the red of the chillis and green of the basil, topped with the orange of the fried
        egg make it very
        aesthetically pleasing, as well as delicious.</p>
